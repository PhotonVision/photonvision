This folder contains images of the AprilTags on the 2024 playing field. All measurements included
are approximate and are intended to give a rough idea of views from various distances from field
elements. All images were taken with a Microsoft Lifecam at 1280x720 resolution.
Camera height: ~29.75 in
Camera ~20 degrees pitch above horizontal
The folder includes 2 types of images:
1. "General Field" images which provide a
general idea of the view from various spots on the field with a camera at this
height and angle.
2. Specific field element images which include a measurement away from a specific field element.
The Amp, Loading, and Stage photos are measured to the face of the respective elements,
approximately perpendicular from the face. The remaining photos are all measured to the center of
the subwoofer face, perpendicular or diagonal as necessary.
