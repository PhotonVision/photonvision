PhotonVision is the free, fast, and easy-to-use computer vision solution for the *FIRST* Robotics Competition. You can read an overview of our features [on our website](https://photonvision.org). You can find our comprehensive documentation [here](https://docs.photonvision.org).

The latest release of platform-specific jars and images is found [here](https://github.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/releases).

If you are interested in contributing code or documentation to the project, please [read our getting started page for contributors](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/contributing/index.html) and **[join the Discord](https://discord.gg/wYxTwym) to introduce yourself!** We hope to provide a welcoming community to anyone who is interested in helping.

## Documentation

- Our main documentation page: [docs.photonvision.org](https://docs.photonvision.org)
- Photon UI demo: [demo.photonvision.org](https://demo.photonvision.org) (or [manual link](https://photonvision.github.io/photonvision/built-client/))
- Javadocs: [javadocs.photonvision.org](https://javadocs.photonvision.org) (or [manual link](https://photonvision.github.io/photonvision/built-docs/javadoc/))
- C++ Doxygen  [cppdocs.photonvision.org](https://cppdocs.photonvision.org) (or [manual link](https://photonvision.github.io/photonvision/built-docs/doxygen/html/))

## Building

Gradle is used for all C++ and Java code, and NPM is used for the web UI. Instructions to compile PhotonVision yourself can be found [in our docs](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/contributing/photonvision/build-instructions.html?highlight=npm%20install#compiling-instructions).

You can run one of the many built in examples straight from the command line, too! They contain a fully featured robot project, and some include simulation support. The projects can be found inside the [`photonlib-java-examples`](photonlib-java-examples) and [`photonlib-cpp-examples`](photonlib-cpp-examples) subdirectories, respectively. Instructions for running these examples directly from the repo are found [in the docs](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/contributing/photonvision/build-instructions.html#running-examples).

## Gradle Arguments

Note that these are case sensitive!

* `-PArchOverride=foobar`: builds for a target system other than your current architecture. Valid overrides are:
    * linuxathena
    * linuxarm64
    * arm64
    * x86-64
    * x86
- `-PtgtIp`: Specifies where `./gradlew deploy` should try to copy the fat JAR to
- `-Pprofile`: enables JVM profiling

## Out-of-Source Dependencies

PhotonVision uses the following additonal out-of-source repositories for building code.

- Base system images for Raspberry Pi & Orange Pi: https://github.com/PhotonVision/photon-image-modifier
- C++ driver for Raspberry Pi CSI cameras: https://github.com/PhotonVision/photon-libcamera-gl-driver
- JNI code for [mrcal](https://mrcal.secretsauce.net/): https://github.com/PhotonVision/mrcal-java
- Custom build of OpenCV with GStreamer/Protobuf/other custom flags: https://github.com/PhotonVision/thirdparty-opencv
- JNI code for aruco-nano: https://github.com/PhotonVision/aruconano-jni

## Additional packages

For now, using mrcal requires installing these additional packages on Linux systems:

```
sudo apt install libcholmod3 liblapack3 libsuitesparseconfig5
```
