Advanced Command Line Usage
===========================
PhotonVision exposes some command line options which may be useful for customizing execution on Debian-based installations.

Running a JAR File
------------------
Assuming ``java`` has been installed, and the appropriate environment variables have been set upon installation (a package manager like ``apt`` should automatically set these), you can use ``java -jar`` to run a JAR file. If you downloaded the latest stable JAR of PhotonVision from the `GitHub releases page <https://github.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/releases>`_, you can run the following to start the program:

.. code-block:: bash

    java -jar /path/to/photonvision/photonvision.jar

Updating a JAR File
-------------------
When you need to update your JAR file, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://git.io/JqkQ9 -O update.sh
    sudo chmod +x update.sh
    sudo ./update.sh
    sudo reboot now

Creating a ``systemd`` Service
------------------------------
You can also create a systemd service that will automatically run on startup. To do so, first navigate to ``/lib/systemd/system``. Create a file called ``photonvision.service`` (or name it whatever you want) using ``touch photonvision.service``. Then open this file in the editor of your choice and paste the following text:

.. code-block::

    [Unit]
    Description=Service that runs PhotonVision

    [Service]
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/photonvision
    # Optional: run photonvision at "nice" -10, which is higher priority than standard
    # Nice=-10
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /path/to/photonvision/photonvision.jar

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Then copy the ``.service`` file to ``/etc/systemd/system/`` using ``cp photonvision.service /etc/systemd/system/photonvision.service``. Then modify the file to have ``644`` permissions using ``chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/photonvision.service``.

.. note::
   Many ARM processors have a big.LITTLE architecture where some of the CPU cores are more powerful than others. On this type of architecture, you may get more consistent performance by limiting which cores PhotonVision can use. To do this, add the parameter ``AllowedCPUs`` to the systemd service file in the ``[Service]`` section.

   For instance, for an Orange Pi 5, cores 4 through 7 are the fast ones, and you can target those cores with the line ``AllowedCPUs=4-7``.

Installing the ``systemd`` Service
----------------------------------
To install the service, simply run ``systemctl enable photonvision.service``.

.. note:: It is recommended to reload configurations by running ``systemctl daemon-reload``.
