Deploying on Custom Hardware
============================

Configuration
-------------

By default, PhotonVision attempts to make minimal assumptions of the hardware it runs on. However, it may be configured to enable custom LED control, branding, and other functionality.

``hardwareConfig.json`` is the location for this configuration. It is included when settings are exported, and can be uploaded as part of a .zip, or on its own.

LED Support
-----------

For Raspberry-Pi based hardware, PhotonVision can use `PiGPIO <https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/>`_ to control IO pins. The mapping of which pins control which LED's is part of the hardware config. The pins are active-high: set high when LED's are commanded on, and set low when commanded off.

.. tab-set-code::
   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "ledPins" : [ 13 ],
        "ledSetCommand" : "",
        "ledsCanDim" : true,
        "ledPWMRange" : [ 0, 100 ],
        "ledPWMSetRange" : "",
        "ledPWMFrequency" : 0,
        "ledDimCommand" : "",
        "ledBlinkCommand" : "",
        "statusRGBPins" : [ ],
      }

.. note:: No hardware boards with status RGB LED pins or non-dimming LED's have been tested yet. Please reach out to the development team if these features are desired, they can assist with configuration and testing.

Hardware Interaction Commands
-----------------------------

For Non-Raspberry-Pi hardware, users must provide valid hardware-specific commands for some parts of the UI interaction (including performance metrics, and executing system restarts).

Leaving a command blank will disable the associated functionality.

.. tab-set-code::
   .. code-block::  json

      {
        "cpuTempCommand" : "",
        "cpuMemoryCommand" : "",
        "cpuUtilCommand" : "",
        "gpuMemoryCommand" : "",
        "gpuTempCommand" : "",
        "ramUtilCommand" : "",
        "restartHardwareCommand" : "",
      }

.. note:: These settings have no effect if PhotonVision detects it is running on a Raspberry Pi. See `the MetricsBase class <https://github.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/blob/dbd631da61b7c86b70fa6574c2565ad57d80a91a/photon-core/src/main/java/org/photonvision/common/hardware/metrics/MetricsBase.java>`_ for the commands utilized.

Known Camera FOV
----------------

If your hardware contains a camera with a known field of vision, it can be entered into the hardware configuration. This will prevent users from editing it in the GUI.

.. tab-set-code::
   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "vendorFOV" : 98.9
      }

Cosmetic & Branding
-------------------

To help differentiate your hardware from other solutions, some customization is allowed.

.. tab-set-code::
   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "deviceName" : "Super Cool Custom Hardware",
        "deviceLogoPath" : "",
        "supportURL" : "https://cat-bounce.com/",
      }

.. note:: Not all configuration is currently presented in the User Interface. Additional file uploads may be needed to support custom images.

Example
-------

Here is a complete example ``hardwareConfig.json``:

.. tab-set-code::
   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "deviceName" : "Blinky McBlinkface",
        "deviceLogoPath" : "",
        "supportURL" : "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-CvLWbfZhU",
        "ledPins" : [2, 13],
        "ledSetCommand" : "",
        "ledsCanDim" : true,
        "ledPWMRange" : [ 0, 100 ],
        "ledPWMSetRange" : "",
        "ledPWMFrequency" : 0,
        "ledDimCommand" : "",
        "ledBlinkCommand" : "",
        "statusRGBPins" : [ ],
        "cpuTempCommand" : "",
        "cpuMemoryCommand" : "",
        "cpuUtilCommand" : "",
        "gpuMemoryCommand" : "",
        "gpuTempCommand" : "",
        "ramUtilCommand" : "",
        "restartHardwareCommand" : "",
        "vendorFOV" : 72.5
      }
