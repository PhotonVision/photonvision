# Advanced Installation

This page will help you install PhotonVision on non-supported coprocessor.

## Step 1: Software Install

This section will walk you through how to install PhotonVision on your coprocessor. Your coprocessor is the device that has the camera and you are using to detect targets (ex. if you are using a Limelight / Raspberry Pi, that is your coprocessor and you should follow those instructions).

:::{warning}
You only need to install PhotonVision on the coprocessor/device that is being used to detect targets, you do NOT need to install it on the device you use to view the webdashboard. All you need to view the webdashboard is for a device to be on the same network as your vision coprocessor and an internet browser.
