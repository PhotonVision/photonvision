# Advanced Installation

This page will help you install PhotonVision on non-supported coprocessor.

:::{warning}
You only need to install PhotonVision on the coprocessor/device that is being used to detect targets, you do NOT need to install it on the device you use to view the webdashboard. All you need to view the webdashboard is for a device to be on the same network as your vision coprocessor and an internet browser.
