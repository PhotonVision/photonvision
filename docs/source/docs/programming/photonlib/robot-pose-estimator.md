# AprilTags and PhotonPoseEstimator

:::{note}
For more information on how to methods to get AprilTag data, look {ref}`here <docs/programming/photonlib/getting-target-data:Getting AprilTag Data From A Target>`.
:::

PhotonLib includes a `PhotonPoseEstimator` class, which allows you to combine the pose data from all tags in view in order to get a field relative pose. For each camera, a separate instance of the `PhotonPoseEstimator` class should be created.

## Creating an `AprilTagFieldLayout`

`AprilTagFieldLayout` is used to represent a layout of AprilTags within a space (field, shop at home, classroom, etc.). WPILib provides a JSON that describes the layout of AprilTags on the field which you can then use in the AprilTagFieldLayout constructor. You can also specify a custom layout.

The API documentation can be found in here: [Java](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/apriltag/AprilTagFieldLayout.html), [C++](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_april_tag_field_layout.html), and [Python](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/projects/apriltag/en/stable/robotpy_apriltag/AprilTagFieldLayout.html#robotpy_apriltag.AprilTagFieldLayout).

## Defining the Robot to Camera `Transform3d`

Another necessary argument for creating a `PhotonPoseEstimator` is the `Transform3d` representing the robot-relative location and orientation of the camera. A `Transform3d` contains a `Translation3d` and a `Rotation3d`. The `Translation3d` is created in meters and the `Rotation3d` is created with radians. For more information on the coordinate system, please see the {ref}`Coordinate Systems <docs/apriltag-pipelines/coordinate-systems:Coordinate Systems>` documentation.

## Creating a `PhotonPoseEstimator`

The PhotonPoseEstimator has a constructor that takes an `AprilTagFieldLayout` (see above), `PoseStrategy`, `PhotonCamera`, and `Transform3d`. `PoseStrategy` has nine possible values:

- MULTI_TAG_PNP_ON_COPROCESSOR
  - Calculates a new robot position estimate by combining all visible tag corners. Recommended for all teams as it will be the most accurate.
  - Must configure the AprilTagFieldLayout properly in the UI, please see {ref}`here <docs/apriltag-pipelines/multitag:multitag localization>` for more information.
- LOWEST_AMBIGUITY
  - Choose the Pose with the lowest ambiguity.
- CLOSEST_TO_CAMERA_HEIGHT
  - Choose the Pose which is closest to the camera height.
- CLOSEST_TO_REFERENCE_POSE
  - Choose the Pose which is closest to the pose from setReferencePose().
- CLOSEST_TO_LAST_POSE
  - Choose the Pose which is closest to the last pose calculated.
- AVERAGE_BEST_TARGETS
  - Choose the Pose which is the average of all the poses from each tag.
- MULTI_TAG_PNP_ON_RIO
  - A slower, older version of MULTI_TAG_PNP_ON_COPROCESSOR, not recommended for use.
- PNP_DISTANCE_TRIG_SOLVE
  - Use distance data from best visible tag to compute a Pose. This runs on the RoboRIO in order
    to access the robot's yaw heading, and MUST have addHeadingData called every frame so heading
    data is up-to-date. Based on a reference implementation by [FRC Team 6328 Mechanical Advantage](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/frc-6328-mechanical-advantage-2025-build-thread/477314/98).
- CONSTRAINED_SOLVEPNP
  - Solve a constrained version of the Perspective-n-Point problem with the robot's drivebase
    flat on the floor. This computation takes place on the RoboRIO, and should not take more than 2ms.
    This also requires addHeadingData to be called every frame so heading data is up to date.
    If Multi-Tag PNP is enabled on the coprocessor, it will be used to provide an initial seed to
    the optimization algorithm -- otherwise, the multi-tag fallback strategy will be used as the
    seed.

```

:::{note}
Python still takes a `PhotonCamera` in the constructor, so you must create the camera as shown in the next section and then return and use it to create the `PhotonPoseEstimator`.

## Using a `PhotonPoseEstimator`

The final prerequisite to using your `PhotonPoseEstimator` is creating a `PhotonCamera`. To do this, you must set the name of your camera in Photon Client. From there you can define the camera in code.

```{eval-rst}
.. tab-set-code::
    .. rli:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/refs/heads/main/photonlib-java-examples/poseest/src/main/java/frc/robot/Vision.java
     :language: java
     :lines: 63

    .. rli:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/refs/heads/main/photonlib-cpp-examples/aimattarget/src/main/include/Robot.h
     :language: c++
     :lines: 55

    .. rli:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/refs/heads/main/photonlib-python-examples/poseest/robot.py
     :language: python
     :lines: 44
```

Calling `update()` on your `PhotonPoseEstimator` will return an `EstimatedRobotPose`, which includes a `Pose3d` of the latest estimated pose (using the selected strategy) along with a `double` of the timestamp when the robot pose was estimated.

```{eval-rst}
.. tab-set-code::
   .. rli:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/refs/heads/main/photonlib-java-examples/poseest/src/main/java/frc/robot/Vision.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 93-116

   .. rli:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/refs/heads/main/photonlib-cpp-examples/poseest/src/main/include/Vision.h
    :language: c++

     :language: python
     :lines: 53
```

You should be updating your [drivetrain pose estimator](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/advanced-controls/state-space/state-space-pose-estimators.html) with the result from the `PhotonPoseEstimator` every loop using `addVisionMeasurement()`.
