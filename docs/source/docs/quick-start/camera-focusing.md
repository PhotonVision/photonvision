# Camera Focusing

## Prepare Camera
:::{warning}
Refocusing your camera **will** make your calibration inaccurate, make sure to recalibrate after focusing.
:::
To ensure that your camera is focused properly, mount it to a secure surface and ensure it does not move drastically. Point your camera at a detailed surface like a calibration board, and make sure that it not too close to the camera.

## Using Focus Mode
:::{important}
When you enable Focus Mode, it will assign a *Score* to the current focus, this score depends on your environment and the lighting. This score cannot be compared to a focus score collected from other environments.
:::
- In the Cameras tab, turn on Focus Mode.
- Rotate the lens on your camera to try and get the focus score as high as possible.
- Once you cannot get a higher score, this indicates that your camera is fully focused and can be set in place using glue if desired.
