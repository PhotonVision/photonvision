# Camera Focusing

## Prepare Camera

To ensure that your camera is focused properly, mount it to a secure surface and ensure it does not move drastically. Point your camera at a detailed surface like a calibration board, this may help with focusing.

## Using Focus Tool
:::{important}
The focus tool will assign a *Score* to the current focus, this score depends on your environment and the lighting, and cannot be used for comparison.
:::
- In the Cameras tab, turn on focus mode.
- Rotate the lens on your camera to try and get the focus value as high as possible.
- Once you cannot get a higher value, this indicates that your camera is fully focused and can be set in place using glue if desired.
