# Arducam Cameras

Arducam cameras are supported for setups with multiple devices. This is possible because Arducam provides software that allows you to assign truly different device names to each camera. This feature is particularly useful in complex setups where multiple cameras are used simultaneously.

## Setting Up Arducam Cameras

1. **Download Arducam Software**: [Download and install the Arducam software from their official website.](https://docs.arducam.com/UVC-Camera/Serial-Number-Tool-Guide/)

2. **Assign Device Names**: Use the Arducam software and Arducam [documentation](https://docs.arducam.com/UVC-Camera/Serial-Number-Tool-Guide/) to give each camera a unique device name. This will help in distinguishing between multiple cameras in your setup.
