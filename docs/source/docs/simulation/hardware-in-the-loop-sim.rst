Hardware In The Loop Simulation
===============================

Hardware in the loop simulation is using a physical device, such as a supported co-processor running PhotonVision, to enhance simulation capabilities. This is useful for developing and validating code before the camera is attached to a robot, as well as reducing the work required to use WPILib simulation with PhotonVision.

Before continuing, ensure PhotonVision is installed on your target device. Instructions can be found :ref:`here <docs/installation/index:Installation & Setup>` for all devices.

Your coprocessor and computer running simulation will have to be connected to the same network, like a home router. Connecting the coprocessor directly to the computer will not work.

To simulate with hardware in the loop, a one-line change is required. From the PhotonVision UI, go to the sidebar and select the Settings option. Within the Networking settings, find "Team Number/NetworkTables Server Address".

During normal robot operation, a team's number would be entered into this field so that the PhotonVision coprocessor connects to the roboRIO as a NT client. Instead, enter the IP address of your computer running the simulation here.

.. note::

   To find the IP address of your Windows computer, open command prompt and run ``ipconfig``.

   .. code-block:: console

      C:/Users/you>ipconfig

      Windows IP Configuration

      Ethernet adapter Ethernet:

         Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : home
         Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::b41d:e861:ef01:9dba%10
         IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.254.13
         Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0

No code changes are required, PhotonLib should function similarly to normal operation.

Now launch simulation, and you should be able to see the PhotonVision table on your simulation's NetworkTables dashboard.
