AprilTag Pipeline Types
=======================

PhotonVision offers two different AprilTag pipeline types based on different implementations of the underlying algorithm. Each one has its advantages / disadvantages, which are detailed below.

.. note:: Note that both of these pipeline types detect AprilTag markers and are just two different algorithms for doing so.

AprilTag
--------

The AprilTag pipeline type is based on the `AprilTag <https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag.html>`_ library from the University of Michigan and we recommend it for most use cases. It is (to our understanding) most accurate pipeline type, but is also ~2x slower than AruCo. This was the pipeline type used by teams in the 2023 season and is well tested.

AruCo
-----
The AruCo pipeline is based on the `AruCo <https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/d9/d6a/group__aruco.html>`_ library implementation from OpenCV. It is ~2x higher fps and ~2x lower latency than the AprilTag pipeline type, but is less accurate. We recommend this pipeline type for teams that need to run at a higher framerate or have a lower powered device. This pipeline type is new for the 2024 season and is not as well tested as AprilTag.
