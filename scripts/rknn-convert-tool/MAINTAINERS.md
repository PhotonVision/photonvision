# Notebook

For the installation script found in the first cell of the RKNN conversion
notebook, please make sure that `GITHUB_URL` is the current url of the repository, and `SCRIPTS_FOLDER`
is the path to the `create_onnx.py`, `autoinstallrknnapi.py`, `create_rknn.py` starting from the repo's root directory. 
Make sure that all scripts required for the notebook are in the same folder.
